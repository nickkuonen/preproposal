# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO- The Title will be Blackjack Game or Python Casino

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO- It is standard blackjack where the user selects how much money they start with and they play against the computer who is the dealer.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO- My software will opperate like how blackjack works at a casino. The player chooses how much money they start with and then can select individual wagers. The program/computer acts like the dealer. The player can hit, stand, or split as much as they want, as long as their total is below 21. If they go over, they automatically lose. The dealer has to hit till at least 17, if they go over, the player wins. A player will get double their wager if they win, or 2.5X if they get a blackjack.The player can stop playing whenever they want and will be told how much they won or lost.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable- N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO- I will accomplish a blackjack program that will have the user be the player and the program/computer be the dealer. It will tell you whats your total and if you won or lost.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO- A better outcome will show what cards each person received and have more detail like how much they won or lost and will have a nice interface.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO- The best outcome is I am able to incorperate more casino games like roulette or poker.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO- My next steps is starting to research blackjack and the exact rules. I need the game to function exactly like how it would in a casino. I need to strengthen my skills is choosing random variables and using lists/values. I am working alone so I will be doing everything by myself.
